# GPTranslator JSON

I was facing an issue at work with translating things using `i18n`, where I had a JSON file containing translations for `pt-BR`, `pt-PT`, `es-ES`, `es-MX`, `fr-FR` and `en-US`. Instead of going to the translator, copying the keys and values, I thought about automating it using the OpenAI API to do these translations. The application is not limited to my work; you can paste your JSON and it will translate it into the language of your choice.

Fell free to send PRs to make it better xD
